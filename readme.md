## Stanford Machine Learning in F#

This is my second run through the course, my first time was cut short by moving house 
followed by a big gap in internet access at home which meant that I didn't get a 
chance to view the last couple of weeks of videos or do the associated exercises.

To keep my interest up whilst I wait for the course to catch up with where I left off
I'm going to complete the material in F# as well. Plus it gives me an excuse to play
around with Math.Net Numerics and gnuplot!
